# HappyPath Coding Challenge

## Welcome
Welcome to the HappyPath frontend take home exam. This challenge is designed to assess your problem-solving skills and coding abilities in a real-world scenario. The task is to build a form that accepts CSV files and allows a user to map the CSV headers to a set of predefined headers. Out of respect for your time please limit your effort to a maximum of 4 hours. If there is any aspect that you did not get to complete feel free to leave comments explaining your approach.

## Objective
Your goal is to create a user-friendly interface that:
1. Takes a CSV file as input and parses the headers.
2. Uses these headers to generate form fields for mapping.
3. Parses the form data and constructs a POST request payload.

The CSV file for this challenge can be found in the root of the project directory.

### Example Mapping:
- Ticket ID => ID
- Task Status => Status
- Feature Name => Ticket Name
- Start Date => Open Date
- End Date => Close Date

### Technical Details
- There is no backend required for this assignment.
- You should emit a mock request with a properly structured payload.
- You are free to use any dependencies you find necessary.

## Repository Setup
1. Clone the repository from the provided URL.
2. Install dependencies using the command: `npm install`.
3. Start the application with: `npm run dev`.
4. The application should launch at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/).

## Evaluation Criteria
We are looking to get an idea about how you approach solving problems as well as your coding style. We are not looking for nor expecting a production ready application.

- **Effective problem-solving:** Show us how you approach and solve complex tasks.
- **Clean, well-organized code:** Your code should be easy to read and understand.
- **User Experience:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
